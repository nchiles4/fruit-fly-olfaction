# Fruit Fly Bloom Filter

  Deep neural networks are among the most powerful methods for storing and manipulating complex data, though they require high computing power and large volumes of training data. Biological neural systems present unique benefits because accurate predictions can be made with constrained training data and low computing power through a simple training algorithm. Here, we examined the Drosophila olfactory network as a model for low data problems. Our model implements a locality- and novelty-sensitive Bloom filter which stores information as a series of binary bits and infers the identity of input data by the locations of these bits. With as few as a dozen training inputs, this model outperformed traditional supervised machine learning methods in both accuracy and recall by as much as 15%, however this advantage was eliminated when training sizes were sufficiently large. The model seems to capitalize on shared characteristics of small classes of input data in high dimensions which are not captured by other classifiers. These results show some promise for probabilistic biologically inspired algorithms as solutions to complex problems with restricted or complex data, particularly drug discovery and anomaly detection.
